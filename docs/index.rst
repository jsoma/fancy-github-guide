Let's make you a fancy GitHub.
========================================

`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ is a website to post all of your awful code, sure. It's a website to complain about how other peoples' awful code isn't working, yes. But:

It's also  place where you can **show off a little bit.** So let's do that! Let's customize your GitHub until it shines like an uncomfortably bright sun.
